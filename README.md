## Identifying Components
This frontend is designed to integrate seamlessly with the [Yurjinia Java backend](https://github.com/Yurjinia/Yurjinia).  
After reviewing the backend codebase, I mapped out the **core UI components** needed to reflect the backend entities and workflows.

## Wireframing & Iteration
When **Samvel Aivazian** (backend engineer) suggested creating a frontend, I took on the challenge.  
Although his initial idea leaned toward a minimalistic, Jira-like interface, I explored multiple layouts before finding the right balance between **simplicity and functionality**.

## Collaboration & Refinement
The wireframes went through several review cycles with Samvel to ensure **frontendâ€“backend alignment** and define clear integration paths.

## Technology Stack
Development is currently in progress with **React + TypeScript**, translating the wireframes into interactive, reusable components.
